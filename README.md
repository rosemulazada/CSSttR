## Installation

Here are the steps to install my project.

1. Under the `Code` tab at the top (the big green button).
2. Download this repository as a `.zip` file and unpack it.
3. Locate the folder `CSSttR`
    - If you have `VS Code`: From here, all you need to do is open the folder in your editor and use the `Live Server` extension to start a local host. This allows you to also view the code and work more hands-on, should you desire.
    - If not, you can find the document on your device, navigate to the `index.html` file (this should be visible just by opening up `CSSttR`), right-click it and open in a browser of your choosing. I've used Arc and Google Chrome to test this project, so I can recommend these two.

## My project

Inspired by the module option of this assignment, I quickly found myself grasping for devices from my youth to play with. Not wanting to go with the generic items like the Nintendo Switch, I opted for the Playstation Portable, or the PSP as it's better known by. For those unfamiliar, or just for a visual refresher, this is that module.

![PSP device](https://images.versus.io/objects/sony-psp-3000.front.variety.1591878256408.jpg)

It has a couple things to note.

1. Its unique shape.
2. The buttons, which there are at least eight of excluding the power button.
3. The screen.
