## Introduction to the assignment

## Installation

Here are the steps to install my project.

1. Under the `Code` tab at the top (the big green button).
2. Download this repository as a `.zip` file and unpack it.
3. Locate the folder `CSSttR`
    - If you have `VS Code`: From here, all you need to do is open the folder in your editor and use the `Live Server` extension to start a local host. This allows you to also view the code and work more hands-on, should you desire.
    - If not, you can find the document on your device, navigate to the `index.html` file (this should be visible just by opening up `CSSttR`), right-click it and open in a browser of your choosing. I've used Arc and Google Chrome to test this project, so I can recommend these two.

## My project

Inspired by the module option of this assignment, I quickly found myself grasping for devices from my youth to play with. Not wanting to go with the generic items like the Nintendo Switch, I opted for the Playstation Portable, or the PSP as it's better known by. For those unfamiliar, or just for a visual refresher, this is that module.

### Before any code: what are my thoughts/plans?

The PSP has a few things to note.

1. Its unique shape.
2. The buttons, which there are at least eight of excluding the power button.
3. The screen.

### CSS features I want to use

`:has()` is one that I'm fascinated by, and one that I know will be the feature every other student names too but it comes with good reason. It's like a little slice of JavaScript in CSS, which to me is fascinating and I'm excited to learn about what other possibilities will be implemented from `:has()` in the future. But I plan to use `:has(input:checked)` to toggle an animation on the PSP screen, when the input is checked: the input being the PSP buttons which I've styled.

## Takeaway from feedback

Every friday, we have a feedback session with four students total and the teacher for the class, where we show our work, what we're struggling with, what we'd like to do and help eachother progress. Here's a log of each session.
